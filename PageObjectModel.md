# Scalability, Reusability, and Maintainability

A **Page Object Model (POM)** file can be used when you want to make your test code scalable, maintainable, and reusable — especially in projects with growing UI complexity or multiple test contributors.

Use **POM** when building tests that need to be reused, scaled, and maintained — especially in Agile/CI environments where changes might be frequent.

### When to Use a POM File

| Scenario                      | Why Use POM                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Repetitive UI Interactions    | Centralize common actions (login, navigation, form fill) to avoid code duplication across tests |
| Medium-to-Large Test Suites   | Separates concerns and makes the codebase easier to maintain as your test base grows            |
| Multiple Engineers            | Enables shared understanding and collaboration with reusable page objects                       |
| UI Changes Are Frequent       | Update locators/actions in one place, reducing maintenance efforts                              |
| Complex UI Workflows          | Encapsulates sequences of steps (e.g., cart checkout, profile updates) as atomic methods        |
| E2E/Integration Testing       | Keeps test logic focused on what you're testing rather than how you're interacting with the UI  |

### When Not to Use POM

- For simple, short-lived proof-of-concept tests.
- When writing single-use scripts with only a few lines.
- If your team prefers inline locators for extremely fast feedback and doesn’t expect scale.

### Should a *Page Object Model (POM)* be used for older or maintenance-mode applications?
— depends on your goals for test reliability, maintainability, and future-proofing.

## When You Should Use POM for *older* or *maintenance-mode* applications

| Example Condition	                                                      | Reason                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tests are reused or shared across many suites.	                      | POM helps centralize UI logic and avoids duplicated locators or actions|
| The UI still changes occasionally.	                                  | Updating one POM file is far easier than modifying dozens of tests     |
| Existing test code is fragile or inconsistent.	                      | Refactoring with POM improves stability and readability                |
| You still need regression coverage or critical-path automation.	      | POM makes tests easier to maintain over time                           |
| Multiple team members (QA/devs) need to update/understand test code.    | POM improves collaboration and maintainability                         |

## When you *may not need POM* for older or maintenance-mode mpplications

| Example Condition                                        | Reason                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UI is completely frozen and won't change.                | Duplicated selectors may be tolerable if there’s no maintenance burden |
| App is legacy and being phased out soon.                 | ROI of refactoring tests with POM may not be worth it                  |
| Only a small set of manual smoke tests are automated.    | POM abstraction might add unnecessary complexity                       |
| Test automation is minimal, and no CI/CD is planned.     | Simpler scripts may be sufficient for low-risk testing                 |

## Summary

POM is still beneficial in maintenance-mode apps if you're keeping test automation active, reducing maintenance overhead, or sharing test responsibility across a team.
If the app is frozen, lightly used, or close to deprecation, the effort may not pay off unless you're improving test stability or reducing ongoing risk.
